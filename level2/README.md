* UD morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatisation with Treetagger model trained for Serbian (http://obrada.jerteh.rs/) and integrated into 
* TXM tool (http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/), and 
* Named entity tagging with SrpNER, which is simplefied and mapped to ELTEC NER tagset describled in Annotation guidelines for ELTEC NER (NER-Guidelines - Google документи)  using
