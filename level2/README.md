## Tools
* Tokanization and sentence segmentation was performed with Unitex corpus porcessing suite (https://unitexgramlab.org/);
* UD morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatisation with Treetagger model trained for Serbian (http://obrada.jerteh.rs/) and integrated into 
* TXM tool (http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/), 
* Named entity tagging with SrpNER (http://ner.jerteh.rs/), 
* The output of SrpNER was simplified and mapped to ELTEC NER tagset describled in Annotation guidelines for ELTEC NER using NER & Beyond (http://nerbeyond.jerteh.rs/).
